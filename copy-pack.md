### LinkedIn (long)
I’m supporting deshort — a movement to reclaim attention.

Short‑form video isn’t “just content”. It’s an attention system built around infinite scroll and autoplay.
For many of us (and especially younger generations), it can crowd out deep work, learning, and rest.

The goal isn’t shame. It’s better defaults.
We’re building simple tools that hide Shorts/Reels surfaces in listings, so distraction is less automatic.
